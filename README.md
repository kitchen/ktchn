This is my URL shortener. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This is primarily going to be used for [POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE) [permashortlinks](https://indiewebcamp.com/permashortlinks
) purposes. For the forseeable future I'd like to keep this as an [algorithmic](https://indiewebcamp.com/algorithmic) URL shortener, running on the domain http://ktc.hn/

Since this is primarily being used for [selfdogfooding](http://indiewebcamp.com/selfdogfood), I'm keeping things hardcoded, if for no other reason than to keep things simple enough that I'll actually want to build/maintain it. If I ever get to a 1.0 release, it'll be configurable, probably some sort of 12-factor thing, but that's a long way off, if ever!
